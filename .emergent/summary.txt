The AI engineer systematically developed the EXRSIM application, focusing on critical features and bug fixes. Initial work involved configuring the stack and implementing core modules like Participants, HIRA, MSEL, and the 17-step Exercise Builder. Key issues addressed included the Exercise Builder's save functionality and add buttons, which were fixed via frontend agent. A major challenge was enabling the edit exercise workflow, requiring significant refactoring of frontend routing and data loading to handle existing exercise data. Subsequently, a persistent bug arose where dynamic exercise data (goals, objectives) was not being saved or loaded correctly, necessitating backend model updates and further frontend adjustments for persistence. The current focus is on debugging the frontend's failure to load these dynamic collections when an exercise is opened for editing, despite backend confirmation of data saving.

<product_requirements>
The EXRSIM application is an emergency training platform based on the Canadian Incident Command System. It features a top navigation bar with EXRSIM branding (orange font on black, dark theme), a main dashboard listing selectable exercises (name, description, date/times), and a left-side menu with links to MSEL, HIRA, Participants, and a step-by-step Exercise Builder. The HIRA module allows identifying and assessing threat levels of hazards, while Participants includes CRUD for contact information, position, and involvement in the current exercise, including image uploads and filtering. The Exercise Builder is a 17-step wizard for developing an exercise, encompassing details like exercise type, scope, purpose, scenario, goals, objectives, events (with tier scale and escalation values), functions, injections (from MSEL), organizations, team coordinators (from participant list), code words, callsigns, communication frequencies, assumptions, artificialities, and safety concerns (including identifying Safety Officer). The application should be easy to use and clear.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and FastAPI backend interacting with a MongoDB database.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main FastAPI application file defining API routes and interacting with MongoDB.
    -   **Changes**: The , , and  Pydantic models were significantly expanded. Initially, they contained basic exercise metadata. They were later modified to include comprehensive lists of dynamic data for all 17 steps, such as , , , , , , , , , , , , and . This enabled the backend to store the complex step-by-step exercise data.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Acts as the central hub for the React frontend, handling global state, routing, and incorporating major components, including the .
    -   **Changes**: The  component, initially intended as a separate file, was directly embedded and extensively modified within . Key changes include:
        -   **Edit Functionality**: Modified to accept an  prop.
        -   **Save Logic**: Updated the  function to use  for new exercises and  for updates, dynamically checking for an .
        -   **Routing**: Added a  to the main  component to parse URL hash parameters (e.g., ) to detect edit mode, fetch the corresponding exercise from the backend, and pass it as  to the wizard.
        -   **Dynamic Data Management**: Introduced  hooks within  to manage dynamic lists (e.g., , , ).
        -   **Add Buttons**: Implemented ,  functions and other similar handlers to dynamically add items to the respective state arrays.
        -   **Step Saving**: Created a  function to handle saving individual step data.
        -   **Data Loading**: Added a  within the  to populate its internal state with dynamic data from the  prop when an existing exercise is loaded for editing. Debug logs were recently added to this  to trace loading issues.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Debug and fix the issue where dynamic collections (goals, objectives, events, etc.) are not being loaded into the  state when an existing exercise is opened for editing.
-   Implement individual Save buttons for each step (1-17) of the Exercise Builder.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on a critical bug in the Exercise Builder's edit workflow: when a user attempts to edit a previously saved exercise, the dynamic collections (such as goals, objectives, events, functions, etc.) are not being loaded and pre-populated into the respective form fields, leading to data loss upon re-saving.

Previous testing confirmed that the backend () has been updated successfully to persist all dynamic collections and that the backend API is correctly saving and retrieving this data. The problem has been isolated to the frontend, specifically within the  hook in  that is responsible for populating the 's internal state with the  data.

The AI engineer has added debug logging to this  (around line 2890 in ) to trace the flow of data loading. Recent observations from backend API calls confirmed that saved exercises *do* contain dynamic data, indicating the issue is solely a frontend loading/state-setting problem.
