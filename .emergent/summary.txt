The trajectory documents a multi-stage development process for the EXRSIM application, beginning with the creation and population of an Incident Command System (ICS) Dashboard Overview. This involved fetching and displaying data for Scenarios, Objectives, Incident Status, and Safety, followed by successful automated testing.

The second major phase was a series of rapid, iterative UI enhancements to the ICS sidebar. This included adding new top-level and nested submenu items, applying specific background colors to each, reordering items, and controlling the default collapsed/expanded state of menus based on user requests.

The most substantial and challenging phase was the implementation of a full-featured Leaflet mapping component. This task was fraught with technical difficulties, particularly with the integration of the  plugin, which failed to render or persist correctly through many attempts. The engineer cycled through different libraries, custom hooks, and direct DOM manipulation to resolve rendering loops and visibility issues. Concurrently, a modal for creating map objects also had bugs, including freezing the UI and z-index layering problems. After extensive debugging, the engineer successfully rendered the map with a satellite default view and a functional Add Map Object modal, but the drawing tools remained problematic. The final effort involved implementing a click-to-place mechanism for map objects after the user fills out the form, which was the active task when the trajectory ended.

<product_requirements>
The EXRSIM application requires an advanced Incident Command System (ICS) module to enhance its emergency simulation capabilities.

1.  **ICS Dashboard**: A new view accessible from the main navigation when an exercise is selected. It must contain its own sidebar and a main content area. The initial view should be a Dashboard Overview displaying four key data containers: Scenario, Objectives, Incident Status, and Safety, populated with real-time data from the backend.

2.  **Customizable ICS Sidebar**: The sidebar must be highly customizable. Specific requirements implemented include:
    *   **Menu Structure**: Addition of Command Staff and ICS 2XX Form Series as main items. Creation of nested submenus under Planning, Logistics, and Fin / Admin.
    *   **Color Coding**: Specific background colors for main menu items (e.g., Command Staff: burgundy, Planning: blue, Logistics: yellow, Fin/Admin: grey, ICS 2XX Forms: green).
    *   **Default State**: All menus with sub-items must be collapsed by default on load.

3.  **Advanced Mapping Feature**: A Mapping item within the Planning submenu must launch a full-featured mapping interface powered by Leaflet.
    *   **Map Layers**: Must include Greyscale, Streets, Topographical, Open Street Map, and Satellite views, with Satellite as the default.
    *   **Drawing Tools**: Must include tools to draw lines, polygons, rectangles, and place markers.
    *   **Object CRUD**: When a shape is drawn, the user must be able to add metadata (name, description, color, image) via a modal. All drawn objects and their data must be saved and managed within categorized lists in a dedicated mapping sidebar.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Architecture**: Monolithic structure with a single-file React frontend () and a single-file FastAPI backend ().
- **Frontend**: React (Hooks: , , ), Tailwind CSS for styling, and Leaflet.js with  and  for interactive mapping.
- **Backend**: FastAPI for REST APIs, Pydantic for data modeling, and MongoDB for persistence. API endpoints were added to support CRUD operations for map objects.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monolith with a clear frontend/backend separation.

    - **Importance**: This file contains the entire frontend application, including all components, state management, routing, and API calls. All recent feature development has occurred exclusively within this file.
    - **Summary of Changes**: The file has been significantly expanded. A new  component was created to display summary data. The  component was heavily modified with complex logic for rendering a dynamic, multi-level, color-coded sidebar with collapsible sections. A large and complex  component was created from scratch, involving multiple attempts to integrate the  plugin, manage map state with refs to avoid re-renders, handle map events, and render a modal for data entry. Numerous state variables () were added to manage the UI state of the sidebar and mapping components.

- ****
    - **Importance**: This file is the complete backend, defining all data models and API endpoints.
    - **Summary of Changes**: To support the new mapping feature, new Pydantic models were added to represent different types of map objects (Marker, Line, Polygon, Rectangle). Corresponding FastAPI CRUD endpoints () were created to allow the frontend to save, retrieve, update, and delete these geometric objects and their associated metadata in the MongoDB database.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Map Object Creation**: Finalize the click-to-place functionality, allowing a user to place an object on the map after filling out the modal form.
- **Implement Map Object Persistence**: Ensure that drawn map objects, along with their metadata (name, description, color, image), are saved to the backend via the API and are reloaded onto the map when the view is opened.
- **Implement Placeholder Pages**: Build out the user-facing content for the numerous new sidebar menu items (e.g., Command Staff, Situation Unit, Services, Time Unit).

<current_work>
The most recent work focuses on resolving the final step in the map object creation workflow. The user reported that while the Add Map Object modal and its form fields are now functional and visible, they are unable to click on the map to create the object at a specific location.

The previous AI engineer had just begun implementing the solution for this. The core idea is to introduce a placement mode. After the user fills out the form in the modal and clicks Save, the application enters this mode instead of closing the modal immediately. The cursor would change, and the next click on the map would be captured. This click event's coordinates, combined with the data already entered in the form, would then be used to create and place the new map object.

The last code edits were to introduce the state management for this mode and begin wiring it into the component logic:
1.  Added a new state variable: 
2.  Modified the Save button's  handler in the object form modal to set .
3.  Added the structure for a map click handler () that would execute the placement logic when  is true.

The work stopped just before completing the implementation of this  handler and providing visual feedback to the user that they are in placement mode.

<optional_next_step>
I will now complete the click-to-place functionality by implementing the logic within the  handler to create the object on the map using the form data and the click coordinates.
