The trajectory outlines a comprehensive development cycle, starting from stabilizing an initial MVP to implementing several complex, full-stack features. The initial major task was creating a Digital Scribe Form, which involved significant backend work with nested Pydantic models in  and a complex UI in the monolithic . This led to a critical refactoring of the frontend to resolve React Hooks violations by hoisting state.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to a new Resource Management module. This was built from scratch, including backend models and CRUD APIs, and a feature-rich frontend with filtering, image uploads (camera/file), status badges, and print functionality. The UI was iteratively refined based on user requests, such as removing Personnel categories and converting filter buttons into a dropdown menu.

Following this, two key fixes were implemented: enabling the Load Coordinators button in the Exercise Builder by adding the correct data-fetching and state update logic, and streamlining the Final Report UI by removing redundant summary buttons.

The final and current major feature development is the Evaluation Report system. This involved creating new backend models and APIs and a very detailed multi-section frontend form. This implementation introduced duplication bugs in both the print output and the data entry form itself. The most recent actions were focused on identifying and removing these duplicated code blocks within the  in . The work concluded just after editing the file to remove the duplicates, with the next logical step being to restart the frontend and verify the fix.

<product_requirements>
The application, EXRSIM, is an emergency training and simulation platform. The core product has evolved significantly through several feature requests:

1.  **Digital Scribe Form:** A persistent digital form for logging timeline events, communications, and notes during an exercise. It required full CRUD functionality and strict frontend validation for time inputs in  format.
2.  **Resource Management System:** A comprehensive module to manage exercise resources. Requirements included:
    *   Categorization (initially Personnel, Equipment, Supplies; later simplified to just Equipment and Supplies).
    *   CRUD operations for resources with fields for ID, description, quantity (available vs. needed), location, and contact info.
    *   Image association (via device camera or file upload).
    *   A checkbox to mark if a resource is involved in the current exercise.
    *   Advanced frontend UI with filtering (by category, insufficient quantity, exercise involvement), status badges, and a print summary feature.
    *   UI refinements, including changing filter buttons to a dropdown and standardizing the Location field to use a dropdown list from the Participants section.
3.  **Functional Fixes & UI Enhancements:**
    *   Fix the Load Coordinators button to correctly import participants with the Team Coordinator role who are active in the exercise.
    *   Remove Goals Summary and Safety Summary buttons from the Final Report screen to simplify the UI.
4.  **Evaluation Report System:** A detailed data entry form and report generation system for post-exercise evaluation, requiring:
    *   A multi-section form covering Exercise Overview, Findings, Strengths, Areas for Improvement, Recommendations, and a detailed assessment of 7 key operational areas (e.g., Command & Control, Communication).
    *   Full CRUD, print capabilities, and image upload functionality.
    *   Correction of data duplication appearing in both the print output and the data entry form.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Architecture**: Monolithic single-page application using React () for the frontend and a FastAPI () backend with MongoDB.
- **Backend**: Pydantic models for data validation and schema definition, with new nested models and CRUD API endpoints for Scribes, Resources, and Evaluations.
- **Frontend**: Heavy reliance on React Hooks (, ). A major refactoring was done to hoist state to the top-level component ( or ) to fix hook rule violations.
- **UI Components**: Custom components built within  using a common pattern for forms, lists, filters, and print generation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a simple frontend-backend structure. All frontend logic, components, and state management are contained within a single file, which communicates with a single backend API file.



- ****
    - **Importance**: This file defines the entire backend API, including all data models (Pydantic schemas) and CRUD endpoints. It's the single source of truth for backend logic and database interaction.
    - **Summary of Changes**: The file was significantly expanded to support new features.
        - **Resource Management**: Added , , , and  Pydantic models. Implemented a full suite of CRUD endpoints () for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.
        - **Evaluation Reports**: Added , , , and  Pydantic models, including nested models for key assessment areas. Implemented corresponding CRUD endpoints ().

- ****
    - **Importance**: This is the monolithic heart of the frontend. It contains all React components, state management, API call logic, routing, and UI rendering for the entire application. All new features were implemented by adding large component functions directly into this file.
    - **Summary of Changes**: This file underwent massive additions and refactoring.
        - **Resource Management**: A complete  component was added, containing logic for fetching, displaying, filtering, and printing resources. A complex  component was created to handle adding/editing resources, including image uploads, a new dropdown for location, and phone number validation.
        - **Load Coordinators Fix**: Implemented the  function within the  component, which fetches participants, filters them based on user criteria (Team Coordinator position and  status), and updates the exercise state.
        - **Evaluation System**: Added  and a large  component. This involved adding new state management to , creating API service functions, and building a multi-section form with text areas, dropdowns, and image handling. The most recent edits focused on removing duplicated JSX blocks from this form to fix a UI bug.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Restart the frontend service to apply the code changes that removed the duplicated fields in the .
- Verify through testing that the duplication issue in the Evaluation data input form is fully resolved and the form renders correctly with only unique fields.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate past work focused on resolving a user-reported bug where the newly created Evaluation Report data input form was displaying duplicated sections and fields. The previous engineer correctly identified that sections like Exercise Overview, Key Areas Assessment, and Summary and Findings were erroneously coded twice within the  component in .

The engineer performed a series of  actions to remove the redundant JSX blocks from the file. After removing the duplicated sections, they proceeded to consolidate and enhance the remaining Key Areas Assessment section to ensure it was complete and consistently styled. The work concluded immediately after these file edits were successfully saved. The application's frontend has not yet been restarted to reflect these changes, and no testing has been performed to confirm the fix.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Restart the frontend server to apply the deduplication fixes and then verify that the Add Evaluation form renders correctly without any duplicated fields.
