The trajectory chronicles the evolution of the EXRSIM application from an MVP to a feature-rich platform. The development process was highly iterative, driven by specific user requests. The work began by fixing a UI duplication bug in the Evaluation Report form. This was followed by a series of significant feature enhancements to the same module, including implementing a calculated Overall Rating with a user-defined scale and color-coding, which required changes to both frontend () and backend () logic.

A major effort was dedicated to building a full-stack Lessons Learned module from scratch, complete with new backend models, CRUD APIs, and a complex frontend form featuring image uploads and dynamic dropdowns. This module was subsequently enhanced with cosmetic improvements (square images, color-coded options) and integrated into the After Action Report (formerly Final Report).

Several UI/UX improvements were made, including sidebar cleanup, renaming reports, replacing the logo, and repositioning the settings button. A new Location Management CRUD system was built and integrated into the Participants and Resources forms, replacing hardcoded dropdowns with a dynamic, centralized list.

The most recent task, which is currently in progress, is the implementation of a light/dark theme system. The foundational work, including creating a React Theme Context and Provider and starting to apply theme colors, has been done, but the feature is not yet complete. The monolithic nature of the frontend in  and the backend in  is a consistent architectural pattern throughout the development.

<product_requirements>
The application, EXRSIM, is an emergency training and simulation platform. The initial goal was to stabilize an MVP and then incrementally add features to create a comprehensive exercise management tool.

Key requirements implemented include:
1.  **Evaluation Report System**: A detailed form for post-exercise evaluation. Required fixing data duplication bugs, implementing a dynamic overall rating algorithm with a custom 5-level scale ( to ), and applying specific color-coding to each rating level throughout the UI and printouts.
2.  **Lessons Learned Module**: A full-stack CRUD system for logging lessons. The form required three distinct sections, fields for priority (with color-coding), DOTMPLFICC categories (also color-coded), image uploads, and an auto-incrementing serial number. It also needed print functionality allowing users to select a specific lesson to print.
3.  **Centralized Location Management**: A CRUD interface under a new Settings menu to manage exercise locations (e.g., Command Post, Hospital). This central list was required to dynamically populate the Assigned to dropdowns in both the Participants and Resources modules, replacing static, hardcoded lists.
4.  **UI/UX & Branding Enhancements**:
    *   Simplify the sidebar by removing Deficiencies, Near Misses, and Comments.
    *   Rename Final Report to the industry-standard After Action Report application-wide.
    *   Replace the text-based logo with a professional brand image.
    *   Implement a selectable light/dark theme system accessible from the settings menu.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Architecture**: Monolithic single-page application using React () for the frontend, and a FastAPI () backend with a MongoDB database.
- **Backend**: Pydantic models for data validation and schema definition. Full CRUD API endpoints were created for Evaluation Reports, Lessons Learned, and Locations.
- **Frontend**: Heavy use of React Hooks (, ). The application state is managed at the top-level  component. New features were built as large, self-contained components within .
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for component styling. A React Context () was introduced to manage application-wide light and dark themes.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application's architecture is a simple client-server model with a monolithic frontend and backend.



- ****
    - **Importance**: This file is the entire backend. It contains all FastAPI routes, Pydantic data models, and database logic for interacting with MongoDB. It is the single source of truth for the application's API.
    - **Summary of Changes**: The file was significantly expanded to support new modules. New Pydantic models (, ) and corresponding sets of CRUD API endpoints (, ) were added. Existing models for Evaluation Reports were modified multiple times to accommodate changes in the rating system.

- ****
    - **Importance**: This monolithic file contains the entire React frontend application. All components, state management, API service calls, routing logic, and UI views are defined within this single file, making it the core of the user experience.
    - **Summary of Changes**: This file underwent massive and continuous modifications.
        - **Evaluation System**: The  was debugged and then heavily modified to support two different rating systems and color-coding schemes. An overall rating calculation algorithm was implemented.
        - **Lessons Learned Module**: A large  component and a  view were created from scratch, including logic for state management, image handling, form validation, and print functionality.
        - **Location Management**: A new  modal component was built, along with the logic to fetch and display locations. The participant and resource forms were refactored to consume this dynamic data.
        - **UI & Theme**: The  component was refactored multiple times to replace the logo, move the settings button, and add a dropdown menu. Most recently, a  and  were added at the top level, and a  component was created to allow users to switch themes. The process of applying theme-aware styles to components has begun.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the implementation of the light/dark theme system by applying theme-aware styles to all remaining components in .
- Thoroughly test the theme-switching functionality across the entire application to ensure all UI elements render correctly in both light and dark modes.

<current_work>
The immediate past work focused on initiating the development of a user-selectable light and dark theme for the application. The previous engineer laid the groundwork for this feature by implementing a theme management system using React's Context API.

The following steps were completed in :
1.  **Theme Context Creation**: A  and a  component were created to manage and distribute the current theme (either 'light' or 'dark') and the function to toggle it () throughout the application.
2.  **Provider Integration**: The main  component was wrapped with the  to make the theme state globally available.
3.  **Settings Menu Update**: A new Theme Settings option was added to the General Settings dropdown menu. This option opens a modal for theme selection.
4.  **Theme Settings Component**: A  modal component was created, which allows the user to select either the Light or Dark theme.
5.  **Initial Application**: The engineer began applying the theme to core components. The  component and the main  were updated to use dynamic classes based on the current theme (e.g., , ).

The work stopped after these initial files were modified. The theme has not been applied to the majority of the application's components, such as the various forms and management dashboards.

<optional_next_step>
Continue applying the theme colors and styles to the remaining components within , starting with the , to complete the light/dark theme implementation.
