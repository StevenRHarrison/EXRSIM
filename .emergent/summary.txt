The AI engineer systematically developed the EXRSIM application, a comprehensive emergency training platform, following a phased approach. Initial setup involved configuring the FastAPI backend and React frontend with a dark theme and EXRSIM branding. Key features implemented include a dashboard for exercises, a participants management system with CRUD, image uploads, and filtering; a detailed HIRA (Hazard Identification Risk Assessment) module with extensive risk criteria, image uploads, and risk-based sorting; and a MSEL (Master Sequence Event List) system for event planning with CRUD capabilities. The most significant development is the 17-step Exercise Builder wizard, which guides users through creating exercises with highly detailed steps for events, communications, and safety. Challenges included handling TIFF image formats and debugging the Exercise Builder's save functionality, which is the immediate focus.

<product_requirements>
The EXRSIM application is an emergency training platform based on the Canadian Incident Command System. It features a top navigation bar with EXRSIM branding (orange font on black, dark theme), a main dashboard listing selectable exercises (name, description, date/times), and a left-side menu with links to MSEL, HIRA, Participants, and a step-by-step Exercise Builder. The HIRA module allows identifying and assessing threat levels of hazards, while Participants includes CRUD for contact information, position, and involvement in the current exercise, including image uploads and filtering. The Exercise Builder is a 17-step wizard for developing an exercise, encompassing details like exercise type, scope, purpose, scenario, goals, objectives, events (with tier scale and escalation values), functions, injections (from MSEL), organizations, team coordinators (from participant list), code words, callsigns, communication frequencies, assumptions, artificialities, and safety concerns (including identifying Safety Officer). The application should be easy to use and clear.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and FastAPI backend interacting with a MongoDB database.



- ****:
    - **Importance**: Main FastAPI application file, defines API routes, handles business logic, and interacts with MongoDB.
    - **Changes**: Initial setup for exercises, then extended with CRUD endpoints and Pydantic models for Participants, HIRA, MSEL, and the 17 steps of the Exercise Builder. Includes image handling (base64 encoding) and specific data structures for each module.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: Main React component, handles routing and overall layout, including the navigation bar and sidebar.
    - **Changes**: Integrated , , and routing for , , , , and . Implemented dark theme and custom EXRSIM logo.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: Global CSS styles, primarily Tailwind CSS configuration.
    - **Changes**: Defined dark theme, typography, and styles for custom components and layout elements, adhering to UI/UX guidelines (e.g., gradients, spacing).
- ****:
    - **Importance**: Implements the top navigation bar.
    - **Changes**: Initially displayed EXRSIM text, later modified to incorporate the custom  component and ensure proper styling.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: A custom-designed logo component to replace the problematic TIFF image.
    - **Changes**: Created to provide a professional, emergency-themed logo with orange gradient, red pulsing dot, and EMERGENCY TRAINING subtitle, optimized for the dark theme.
- ** & associated components (, )**:
    - **Importance**: Manages participant information (CRUD).
    - **Changes**:  was enhanced to include image upload, detailed contact fields (address, city, province, country dropdown, phones, email), position dropdown, and an involved in exercise checkbox.  was updated to display these details, including the image, and a filter dropdown (Show All/Show Participating).
- ** & associated components (, )**:
    - **Importance**: Manages Hazard Identification Risk Assessments (CRUD).
    - **Changes**:  was extended significantly to include Name, Description, Notes, a disaster type dropdown, Lat/Lon, and numerous radio button groups for Frequency, Fatalities, Injuries, Evacuation, Property Damage, Critical Infrastructure, Environmental Damage, Business Financial Impact, Psychosocial Impact, and checkboxes for Change in Frequency/Vulnerability.  was updated to display this comprehensive data, hazard images, risk scores, and implement risk-based sorting.
- ** & associated components (, )**:
    - **Importance**: Manages Master Sequence Event List (CRUD).
    - **Changes**:  was created with fields for Event Number, Designated Scenario Time, Event Type, Inject Mode, From, To, Message, Expected Participant Response, Objective/Capability/Critical Task, and Notes.  displays these events, including status indicators and action buttons.
- ** & **:
    - **Importance**: Implements the 17-step exercise creation wizard.
    - **Changes**:  was built to manage state across 17 distinct steps, each with specific forms and fields (e.g., image uploads, dropdowns, radio buttons for escalation values, detailed communication frequencies, dynamic Safety Officer details). This is a multi-page form with navigation and progress indicators.

<pending_tasks>
- Debug and fix the save draft and Complete Exercise buttons within the Exercise Builder, as they are not currently saving exercises or listing them under the main Exercises menu.
- Test and confirm that all add buttons within the Exercise Builder steps (e.g., add goals, add objective, add event, add function) are fully functional.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on addressing the user-reported issue with the Exercise Builder. Specifically, the save draft and Complete Exercise buttons are not functioning as expected, failing to persist exercise data or display newly created exercises on the main dashboard. The AI engineer has already verified that the backend API for exercises is operational and has one existing exercise. The next step in debugging involves ensuring that the  component correctly retrieves and displays exercises created through the Exercise Builder. Additionally, the user has explicitly requested to test and confirm the functionality of all add buttons within the various steps of the Exercise Builder, such as add goals, add objective, and add event. The current activity is centered around testing these functionalities after an update to the  component.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue by thoroughly testing the add buttons within the Exercise Builder's various steps.
