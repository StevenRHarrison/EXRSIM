# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Modal remains open after save attempt, indicating save operation fails silently. No JavaScript errors detected in console logs. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Initial issue was 422 validation error due to missing required fields (exercise_type, location, start_time, end_time). Fixed by updating ScopeModal handleSave function to merge scope data with existing exercise data and provide defaults for empty required fields. However, after fix, save operation appears to not execute at all - no API calls being made. TESTING METHODOLOGY: Comprehensive testing with network monitoring, console log capture, backend log analysis. Tested complete workflow: Navigate to Exercise Management Dashboard → Click Scope → Click Add Scope → Fill form with test data → Click Save → Monitor for API activity.

In Step 5 (Goals), no 'Added Goals' section visible, only empty form for adding new goals. Previously saved dynamic data is missing. 🔍 ROOT CAUSE: Issue likely in ExerciseBuilderWizard useEffect (lines 2890-2900) that should populate dynamic collections state from editingExercise data. The fetchExerciseForEdit function retrieves data correctly from backend, but dynamic collections state (setGoals, setObjectives, etc.) is not being populated. 🚨 USER IMPACT: Users lose all previously saved goals, objectives, events, functions, organizations, code words, callsigns, frequencies, assumptions, artificialities, and safety concerns when editing exercises. This is a critical data persistence issue requiring immediate fix."

    -message: "🎯 FINAL TESTING RESULTS - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Successfully reproduced and analyzed the dynamic collections loading issue in Edit Exercise functionality. ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING: Edit Exercise workflow (Exercises menu → Exercise detail → Edit Exercise button), URL navigation (#builder?exercise=<id>), Edit mode activation (header shows 'Edit Exercise'), Basic exercise data loading (Steps 1-4 populate correctly). ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED: Dynamic collections NOT loading in edit mode. 🔍 DETAILED ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Console logs from useEffect (lines 2890-2900) show: 'Loading dynamic collections from editingExercise: {exercise data}', 'Goals data: []', 'Objectives data: []'. The editingExercise object loads correctly from backend, but goals/objectives arrays are empty ([]). This indicates the issue is NOT in frontend useEffect logic but in backend data retrieval/storage. The useEffect works correctly - it checks for data and would populate state if data existed, but arrays are empty. 🚨 BACKEND INVESTIGATION REQUIRED: The issue appears to be that dynamic collections are not being properly saved to or retrieved from the database. Need to investigate backend exercise-builder API endpoints and data persistence for dynamic collections (goals, objectives, events, functions, organizations, etc.)."

Modal remains open after save attempt, indicating save operation fails silently. No JavaScript errors detected in console logs. 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Initial issue was 422 validation error due to missing required fields (exercise_type, location, start_time, end_time). Applied fix by updating ScopeModal handleSave function to merge scope data with existing exercise data and provide defaults for empty required fields. However, after fix, save operation appears to not execute at all - no API calls being made. 🚨 USER IMPACT: Users cannot save scope data - complete loss of scope functionality. This is a critical blocker for the Scope feature requiring immediate investigation. TESTING METHODOLOGY: Comprehensive testing with network monitoring, console log capture, backend log analysis. Tested complete workflow: Navigate to Exercise Management Dashboard → Click Scope → Click Add Scope → Fill form with test data → Click Save → Monitor for API activity. The handleSave function may not be executing or API calls are being blocked. This requires immediate debugging by the main agent."

NAVIGATION ISSUES FOUND:
- Successfully navigated to Exercise Dashboard
- Successfully clicked on exercise card (Exercise Claybelt with ID: 4bb39755-0b97-4ded-902d-7f9325f3d9a9)
- URL changes to #manage?exercise=4bb39755-0b97-4ded-902d-7f9325f3d9a9 but then redirects back to main dashboard
- ICS breadcrumb navigation not accessible due to routing issues
- Cannot reach the Leaflet mapping interface to test coordinate capture and modal opening

BACKEND STATUS:
- Backend API is working correctly (confirmed via logs)
- Exercise data is being fetched successfully
- Map objects API endpoint is functional

FRONTEND ROUTING ISSUE:
- Application appears to have a client-side routing problem
- URLs with hash fragments (#ics, #manage) are not being handled properly
- This prevents access to the ICS → Planning → Mapping workflow

TESTING STATUS:
❌ UNABLE TO COMPLETE COORDINATE CAPTURE AND MODAL OPENING TEST
❌ Cannot verify if the reported fixes are working
❌ Leaflet mapping interface is inaccessible due to routing issues

RECOMMENDATION:
Main agent should investigate and fix the frontend routing issue before the coordinate capture and modal opening functionality can be properly tested. The routing system needs to properly handle hash-based navigation to ICS sections."
