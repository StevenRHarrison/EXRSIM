All backend integration working perfectly. ✅ NAVIGATION PATH VERIFIED: Successfully navigated complete path: Exercise Dashboard → Exercise Card → ICS → Planning → Mapping. All navigation steps working perfectly with proper URL routing. Leaflet mapping interface loads correctly with satellite view and existing map objects visible. ✅ EXISTING COORDINATE CAPTURE WORKFLOW EXCELLENT: All 4 object type buttons working perfectly (📍 Marker Red, 📏 Line Blue, 🔶 Polygon Orange, ⬜ Rectangle Green). Console shows activation messages: '🎯 Marker creation mode activated', '🎯 Line creation mode activated', etc. Visual status indicator shows 'Active: RECTANGLE mode' confirming placement mode functionality. 3-step process working: '1. Select object type → 2. Click map → 3. Enter details'. ✅ MAP OBJECTS SIDEBAR INTEGRATION: Sidebar shows proper categorization (All Objects: 2, Markers: 2, Lines: 0, Polygons: 0, Rectangles: 0) with existing objects displayed correctly. ⚠️ NATIVE DRAW TOOLBAR VISIBILITY ISSUE: While Leaflet.Draw plugin initializes successfully and all event handlers are configured, the native draw toolbar is not visible in the UI. Console shows '❌ Draw container not found for styling' indicating styling issues. Found leaflet controls (.leaflet-bar, .leaflet-control) but traditional draw toolbar buttons (polygon, polyline, rectangle, circle, marker tools) are not visible to users. ✅ INTEGRATION MAINTAINED: Both workflows coexist - native Leaflet.draw backend integration working alongside existing coordinate capture workflow. No conflicts detected. 🚀 CONCLUSION: The Leaflet Draw plugin is successfully installed, initialized, and integrated at the backend level with comprehensive event handling. The existing coordinate capture workflow provides excellent user experience. However, the native draw toolbar UI is not visible, which means users cannot access traditional drawing tools directly. The implementation is PRODUCTION READY for the existing workflow but requires UI fixes for native draw toolbar visibility."

All expected initialization messages are present. ❌ DOM ELEMENT DETECTION FAILURE: While console shows 'Draw control DOM element found', comprehensive DOM verification reveals: No elements found with selectors .leaflet-draw, .leaflet-draw-toolbar, .leaflet-control-draw, .leaflet-draw-draw-polygon, .leaflet-draw-draw-polyline, .leaflet-draw-draw-rectangle, .leaflet-draw-draw-circle, .leaflet-draw-draw-marker. Only 3 standard Leaflet controls found (zoom, layers, attribution) - no draw controls visible. ✅ EXISTING WORKFLOW CONFIRMED WORKING: All 4 object type buttons (📍 Marker, 📏 Line, 🔶 Polygon, ⬜ Rectangle) are present and functional. Marker creation mode activates correctly with console confirmation. Map container loads properly with satellite view and existing objects. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: The enhanced fixes (timing control with 1000ms delay, map._loaded check, duplicate prevention flag, requestAnimationFrame DOM verification, enhanced debugging) have NOT resolved the core visibility problem. The draw toolbar is being added to the map programmatically but is not appearing in the user interface. This indicates a deeper CSS styling or DOM rendering issue that requires investigation beyond timing and initialization fixes. 🚨 CONCLUSION: The Leaflet Draw toolbar visibility issue persists despite comprehensive fixes. While backend integration is perfect and existing coordinate capture workflow functions excellently, users cannot access the native draw toolbar buttons. This is a CRITICAL FAILURE for the native draw toolbar functionality."

The implementation uses react-leaflet-draw package with EditControl component within FeatureGroup as specified in the review request. ❌ CRITICAL JAVASCRIPT ERRORS PREVENTING MAP RENDERING: Console shows critical error 'Invalid LatLng object: (undefined, -99,40,-99,39,-98,39,-98,40,-99,40)' which prevents the entire Leaflet map container from rendering. This indicates invalid coordinate data being passed to React Leaflet components. ❌ COMPLETE INTERFACE FAILURE: No Leaflet map container found (.leaflet-container), no draw toolbar visible, no React Leaflet Draw EditControl rendered. The mapping interface completely fails to load due to coordinate validation errors. ❌ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The React Leaflet Draw implementation is receiving undefined or invalid coordinate data, causing the entire mapping system to crash before any drawing tools can be rendered. This is a fundamental data validation issue that prevents the React components from initializing. ❌ NAVIGATION SUCCESSFUL BUT INTERFACE BROKEN: Successfully navigated Exercise Dashboard → Exercise Card → ICS → Planning → Mapping, but the mapping interface shows only JavaScript errors and fails to render any map content. ❌ BACKEND INTEGRATION IRRELEVANT: While backend API integration may be working, the frontend React Leaflet Draw implementation is completely non-functional due to coordinate validation failures. ❌ COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION: Previous native Leaflet.draw implementation had toolbar visibility issues but at least rendered the map container. This React Leaflet Draw rewrite is significantly worse - it prevents the entire mapping interface from loading. 🚨 CONCLUSION: The React Leaflet Draw implementation is a CRITICAL FAILURE that makes the mapping functionality completely unusable. The implementation needs immediate coordinate data validation fixes before any drawing functionality can be tested. This represents a major regression from the previous implementation."

Enter details'. ✅ MAP OBJECTS SIDEBAR INTEGRATION: Sidebar shows proper categorization (All Objects: 2, Markers: 2, Lines: 0, Polygons: 0, Rectangles: 0) with existing objects displayed correctly. ⚠️ NATIVE DRAW TOOLBAR VISIBILITY ISSUE: While Leaflet.Draw plugin initializes successfully and all event handlers are configured, the native draw toolbar is not visible in the UI. Console shows '❌ Draw container not found for styling' indicating styling issues. Found leaflet controls (.leaflet-bar, .leaflet-control) but traditional draw toolbar buttons (polygon, polyline, rectangle, circle, marker tools) are not visible to users. ✅ INTEGRATION MAINTAINED: Both workflows coexist - native Leaflet.draw backend integration working alongside existing coordinate capture workflow. No conflicts detected. 🚀 CONCLUSION: The Leaflet Draw plugin is successfully installed, initialized, and integrated at the backend level with comprehensive event handling. The existing coordinate capture workflow provides excellent user experience. However, the native draw toolbar UI is not visible, which means users cannot access traditional drawing tools directly. The implementation is PRODUCTION READY for the existing workflow but requires UI fixes for native draw toolbar visibility."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Basic exercise data loads properly (name, type, description, location, dates, times, images). ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED: Dynamic collections (goals, objectives, events, functions, organizations, etc.) are NOT loading in edit mode. 🔍 DETAILED ANALYSIS: Console logs show debug messages from useEffect around line 2890 in App.js: 'Loading dynamic collections from editingExercise: {exercise data}', 'Goals data: []', 'Objectives data: []'. The editingExercise object is being loaded correctly from backend API, but the goals and objectives arrays are empty ([]).

Backend correctly stores and returns dynamic collections data. The problem is in FRONTEND data loading/state management. The frontend useEffect (lines 2890-2900) receives correct data from API but fails to populate state properly. 🚨 FRONTEND ISSUE CONFIRMED: The reported 'empty arrays []' issue is caused by frontend not properly processing the API response data, not backend returning empty data."

The fetchExerciseForEdit function retrieves data correctly from backend, but dynamic collections state (setGoals, setObjectives, etc.) is not being populated. 🚨 USER IMPACT: Users lose all previously saved goals, objectives, events, functions, organizations, code words, callsigns, frequencies, assumptions, artificialities, and safety concerns when editing exercises. This is a critical data persistence issue requiring immediate fix."

    -message: "🎯 FINAL TESTING RESULTS - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Successfully reproduced and analyzed the dynamic collections loading issue in Edit Exercise functionality. ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING: Edit Exercise workflow (Exercises menu → Exercise detail → Edit Exercise button), URL navigation (#builder?exercise=<id>), Edit mode activation (header shows 'Edit Exercise'), Basic exercise data loading (Steps 1-4 populate correctly). ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED: Dynamic collections NOT loading in edit mode. 🔍 DETAILED ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Console logs from useEffect (lines 2890-2900) show: 'Loading dynamic collections from editingExercise: {exercise data}', 'Goals data: []', 'Objectives data: []'. The editingExercise object loads correctly from backend, but goals/objectives arrays are empty ([]). This indicates the issue is NOT in frontend useEffect logic but in backend data retrieval/storage. The useEffect works correctly - it checks for data and would populate state if data existed, but arrays are empty. 🚨 BACKEND INVESTIGATION REQUIRED: The issue appears to be that dynamic collections are not being properly saved to or retrieved from the database. Need to investigate backend exercise-builder API endpoints and data persistence for dynamic collections (goals, objectives, events, functions, organizations, etc.)."

- Successfully navigated to Exercise Dashboard
- Successfully clicked on exercise card (Exercise Claybelt with ID: 4bb39755-0b97-4ded-902d-7f9325f3d9a9)
- URL changes to #manage?exercise=draw-command but then redirects back to main dashboard
- ICS breadcrumb navigation not accessible due to routing issues
- Cannot reach the Leaflet mapping interface to test coordinate capture and modal opening

BACKEND STATUS:
- Backend API is working correctly (confirmed via logs)
- Exercise data is being fetched successfully
- Map objects API endpoint is functional

FRONTEND ROUTING ISSUE:
- Application appears to have a client-side routing problem
- URLs with hash fragments (#ics, #manage) are not being handled properly
- This prevents access to the ICS → Planning → Mapping workflow

TESTING STATUS:
❌ UNABLE TO COMPLETE COORDINATE CAPTURE AND MODAL OPENING TEST
❌ Cannot verify if the reported fixes are working
❌ Leaflet mapping interface is inaccessible due to routing issues

Weather menu item appears correctly in Planning submenu with blue background and cloud icon as specified in requirements. ❌ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE: JavaScript console shows 'WeatherModule is not defined' error at multiple points in React component rendering (renderICSContent, ICSDashboard, react-stack-bottom-frame). This indicates the WeatherModule component is not properly imported or defined in the frontend code, despite being implemented in App.js lines 14349-14861. ❌ COMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY FAILURE: Due to the JavaScript error, none of the Weather module functionality can be tested: Weather Information heading not displayed, Import Sample Data button not accessible, Province/State dropdowns not rendered, Get Weather Information button not available, Manage Data functionality not accessible, RSS display view not working, CRUD operations interface not available. ✅ BACKEND VERIFICATION: Previous testing confirmed all Weather API endpoints are working correctly with 24 weather locations imported successfully, so the issue is purely frontend JavaScript runtime error. 🚨 URGENT FIX REQUIRED: The WeatherModule component needs proper import/export or component definition fixes to resolve the 'WeatherModule is not defined' error.
