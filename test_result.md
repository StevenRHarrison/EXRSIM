# START - Testing Protocol - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS SECTION
#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The Edit Exercise functionality is working perfectly - dynamic collections load correctly, state management works properly, and users can successfully edit exercises with all previously saved data intact. The user's reported data loss issue appears to be resolved."

REQUIREMENTS TO VERIFY: 1) Navigate to Exercise Builder (create new or edit existing), 2) Verify each step (1-17) has a 'Save Step' button, 3) Test Save Step functionality on representative steps (1, 5, 10, 17) to ensure: button clickable/responsive, loading states work ('Saving...' during save), success feedback provided, data persistence verified by navigating away and back. EXPECTED RESULTS: Each step should have Save Step button with consistent styling (orange border, Save icon), clicking should trigger saveStepDraft function, users can save progress on individual steps, no JavaScript errors during save operations. CODE ANALYSIS: Found 19 saveStepDraft function calls and 32 'Save Step' button references in App.js, indicating implementation across multiple steps. Need comprehensive UI testing to verify all 17 steps have functional Save Step buttons."

In Step 5 (Goals), no 'Added Goals' section visible, only empty form for adding new goals. Previously saved dynamic data is missing. 🔍 ROOT CAUSE: Issue likely in ExerciseBuilderWizard useEffect (lines 2890-2900) that should populate dynamic collections state from editingExercise data.

The editingExercise object loads correctly from backend, but goals/objectives arrays are empty ([]). This indicates the issue is NOT in frontend useEffect logic but in backend data retrieval/storage. The useEffect works correctly - it checks for data and would populate state if data existed, but arrays are empty. 🚨 BACKEND INVESTIGATION REQUIRED: The issue appears to be that dynamic collections are not being properly saved to or retrieved from the database. Need to investigate backend exercise-builder API endpoints and data persistence for dynamic collections (goals, objectives, events, functions, organizations, etc.)."
